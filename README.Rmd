The goal of simults is to simulate time series from various time series models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of simults like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("leonfernandes/simults")
```

## Simulate Data

Currently this package supports ARIMA and GARCH time series models from the *smpspltools* package.
Burn-in is done implicitly where sufficient innovations are assumed to be supplied.

```{r demo}
library(simults)
library(smpspltools)
# simulate from an AR(1) model
mdl <- make_arima(phi = 0.3, theta = 0, delta = 0)
simults(mdl, nsim = 100, innov = rnorm(200))
```
